# News Classification
## About The Project
This project aims to classify news articles from the Hamshahri News dataset into different categories based on their content. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the category of a given news article.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Hamshahri News dataset, which is a collection of Persian news articles from the Hamshahri newspaper in Iran. 

## Approach
The project will use a machine learning approach to classify news articles into categories. The following steps will be taken:

- Data Preparation: The dataset will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any noise and irrelevant information.
- Feature Extraction: The text data will be transformed into a numerical representation using word2vec embeddings.
- Model Selection: A biLSTM neural network model with a word embedding layer will be trained on the features extracted from the text data.
- Model Evaluation: The model will be evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy and other performance metrics.
